<div class="entry-content"><p>Last night, February 26th 2012, my iTunes account was hacked.  The password had been changed and the $81 or so sitting in the account was gone.  Luckily I was awake at 2 AM when it happened.  I never received an email saying my password had changed.  Quickly, I emailed Apple Support informing that I did not purchase the app 江湖行2, and that I couldn&#8217;t even remotely read what app that was (but I was genuinely excited to own the sequel).  The game bought appears to be the free &#8221;<a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=zh-CN&amp;u=http://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/jiang-hu-xing2/id480073223%3Fmt%3D8&amp;ei=FChLT8LqIInz0gG9ho3yDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CFgQ7gEwAw&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%25E6%25B1%259F%25E6%25B9%2596%25E8%25A1%258C2%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26prmd%3Dimvnsa">Rivers and Lakes 2</a>&#8221;.  All costs were for in-app purchase totaling the amount in the account.  They did not spend any more, which I assume is because they did not have my credit card pin number.  I also changed my email password.</p>

<p>Apple quickly (to my delight) emailed me back and credited my account with the funds even though this was an &#8221;<em>exception to the iTunes Store Terms and Conditions, which state that all sales are final.</em>&#8221;  I changed my password and went to sleep satisfied.</p>

<p>All was well today, until about 15 minutes ago.  I received an email saying: $27.52 had been charged to my Apple account.  The thieves had gotten back in.  I attempted to login, but the password had been changed again.  I rushed to change the password, yet again.  After emailing Apple support saying I had been hacked again, I went off to Google to see if anyone else was getting repeatedly hacked.</p>

<p>Well, it appears people are getting hacked <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2665383?start=1215&amp;tstart=0">all the time</a>.  The only thing most users that were hacked had in common, was that they all had some sort of gift card in their account.  Many had only gift card money taken, but some seemed to have Paypal funds stolen and credit cards charged.  Either way, it seems these are happening directly on Apple&#8217;s server which means Apple itself is getting hacked and passwords are being altered.  All of the charges are for overseas in-app purchases which means these aren&#8217;t people snooping on my wifi (might I add that I&#8217;m on a highly secure University campus wifi).  Hopefully Apple will patch this hole quickly.  As for now, I&#8217;ve gone ahead and told Apple to freeze my account.  You might want to do the same.</p>
