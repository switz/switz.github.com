<div class="entry-content"><p>Facebook is great. It might not be for everyone, but to say that it has no positive purpose is just plain ignorant. Everyone who uses Facebook complains about changes constantly (see: newsfeed, messages, redesigns, etc) and within weeks they realize how genius these additions usually are. It is a company that is built on innovation, and it has been clear for a while that Facebook wants to become the next Google.</p>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg has made it obvious that he wants to intertwine Facebook with your life. The timeline is meant to be your life&#8217;s story. I personally am not as fond of the timeline as I believe not many people want to reminisce their awkward social past in high school, but I get the point. Also, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s aesthetically pleasing to read as your eyes have to dart back and forth across two columns. Over a few years, once we&#8217;ve amassed content day in and day out, we&#8217;ll be able to see the places we&#8217;ve been, the people we&#8217;ve met, and the things we&#8217;ve accomplished.</p>

<p>For the past few months, Facebook has ingrained itself into many notable blogs and applications (e.g. Spotify). When you read an article, it is automatically posted into your timeline.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/downloads/images/facebook-read.png" alt="Facebook" /></p>

<p>I for one, believe that nothing should ever be automatically posted to your timeline without direct consent. Just because I read an article does not mean that I endorse said article. Therefore, I never give access to these &#8220;social reader&#8221; applications for that very reason. Now, here&#8217;s the real problem. If I see an article that my friend has read that I&#8217;m interested in, I click on it. Instead of the article loading up like one would expect, it forces me to give that app access to my timeline and my personal information. There is no reason why I should have to give any application my information just to read an article that is open to the free web. It is very frustrating to click on a link, only to be harassed into giving up my privacy.</p>

<p>Sure, I can block the app from sharing with my friends, but I have no way of blocking it from getting access to my information. Here&#8217;s what Yahoo requires from me just to read a simple article.</p>

<h5>THIS APP WILL RECEIVE:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Your basic info</li>
<li>Your e-mail address (*****@***.edu)</li>
<li>Your birthday</li>
<li>Your likes</li>
<li>This app will share videos you watched, articles you read and other activity on Facebook.</li>
</ul>


<p>Why? Why!? Why do I have to give up all of my information just to read an article. Now instead of me reading your article and possibly generating you revenue, I get frustrated and never even reach the website. Please fix this.</p>
