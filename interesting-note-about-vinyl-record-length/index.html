	<a rel="" class="related-link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record#Columbia">Hi! This link is related, so click me.</a>
</div>

<div class="entry-content"><p>This conversation came up due to discussion on Twitter with <a href="https://twitter.com/phish83">@Phish83</a> about pressing the Phish record <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Live_One">A Live One</a></em> on vinyl. One particular track (<a href="http://phish.net/song/tweezer/history">Tweezer</a>) is 30 minutes long.  I thought you could only fit ~22 minutes on the single side of a record, but apparently they have been able to fit up to 45 minutes on each side. They essentially just made the width of each groove smaller, which degraded the sound. I doubt it could hold up Phish&#8217;s wall of music well, but who knows? It&#8217;d be interesting to hear.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LP_record#Columbia">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>CBS Laboratories head research scientist Peter Goldmark led Columbia&#8217;s team to develop a phonograph record that would hold at least 20 minutes per side. Research began in 1941, was suspended during World War II, and then resumed in 1945&#8230;
When initially introduced, 12-inch LPs played for a maximum of 45 minutes, divided over two sides. However, in 1952, Columbia Records began to bring out extended-play LPs that played for as long as 52 minutes, or 26 minutes per side. These were used mainly for the original cast albums of some Broadway musicals&#8230;[These records] remained rare, however, because of mastering limitations, and most LPs continued to be issued with a 30- to 45-minute playing time throughout the lifetime of their production. However, some albums would eventually exceed even the 52-minute limitation, with <strong>single albums going to as long as ninety minutes</strong> in the case of Arthur Fiedler&#8217;s 1976 LP 90 Minutes with Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops, <strong>made by Radio Shack</strong>. However, such records had to be cut with much narrower spacing between the grooves, which allowed for a much smaller amount of dynamic range on the records, and meant that playing the record with a worn needle could damage the record. It also resulted in a much quieter sound.<sup>[1]</sup> Spoken word and comedy albums, not having a wide range of musical instrumentation to reproduce, can be cut with much narrower spacing between the grooves; for example, The Comic Strip, released by Springtime Records in 1981, has a side A lasting 38:04 and a side B lasting 31:08, for a total of 69:12.</p>

<p>In any case, the standard 45-minute playing time of the LP was a significant improvement over that of the previous dominant format, the 78 rpm single, which was generally limited to three to four minutes. At around 14 minutes per side for 10-inch and 23 minutes per side for 12-inch, LPs provided a measured time to enjoy a recording before having to flip discs.</p>

<p>Some record turntables, called record changers, could play a stack of records piled on a specially designed spindle and arm arrangement. Because of this, many multiple-record sets were released in what&#8217;s called <strong>&#8220;automatic sequence.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>[1] (Other notably long albums included the UK version of The Rolling Stones&#8217; Aftermath, with both sides exceeding 26 minutes in length; Genesis&#8217; Duke, with both sides exceeding 27 minutes; Bob Dylan&#8217;s 1976 album Desire, with side two being just shy of thirty minutes; Brian Eno&#8217;s 1975 album Discreet Music, whose A-side exceeded 30 minutes; Miles Davis&#8217; 1972 album Get Up with It, totalling 124:15 over four sides; Todd Rundgren&#8217;s 1975 album Initiation, totaling 67:32 over two sides, as well as his band Utopia&#8217;s 1974 self-titled debut, totaling 59:17 over two sides, and his 1973 album A Wizard, A True Star, whose second side nearly reaches thirty minutes; and La Monte Young&#8217;s Dream House 78&#8217; 17&#8221;, whose two sides were each just under 40 minutes (the running time of the album is indeed 78:17))</p></blockquote>
